# rtclipboard
Realtime Clipboard built with angularjs and firebase.

This is a cloud based clipboard that is synchronised between all your devices in realtime. 
All you have to do is to login with your google account in all the devices you want to share the clipboard.

# Why?
I developed the RT CLIPBOARD to solve a problem I faced whenever I used two computers to program. Sometimes I would wish I could
copy and paste from one computer to another. I wanted to create something simple and quick.

# Firebase And AngularJS
The clipboard is powered by firebase realtime database , firebase authentication and AngularJS.
I used angular ui-router to switch users between the login page and their clipboards.

The clipboard is already functioning, you can paste your stuff in one computer and it will almost instantly appear in another device.
The app is web-based so you can use it on any device.
